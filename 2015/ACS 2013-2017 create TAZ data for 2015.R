1. ACS data here is downloaded for the 2013-2017 5-year dataset. The end year can be updated 
   by changing the *ACS_year* variable. 

2. ACS block group variables used in all instances where not suppressed. If suppressed at the block group 
   level, tract-level data used instead. Suppressed variables may change if ACS_year is changed. This 
   should be checked, as this change could cause the script not to work.

3. Group quarters come from the decennial census so they're outdated. There are some small TAZ-specific 
   additions from university growth that are incorporated in the script. TODO: grow these for 2015.

4. Persons with miltary occupation is from gq_type_mil, which is probably low (since it's both from 2010
   and also only includes those living in group quarters.)  TODO: find better source.

    * Because the 2017$ equivalent of $60,000 in 2000$ ($91,538) doesn't closely align with 2017 ACS income 
      categories, households within the $75,000-$99,999 category will be apportioned above and below $91,538. 
      Using the ACS 2012-2016 PUMS data, the share of households above $91,538 within the $75,000-$99,999 
      category is 0.3042492.That is, approximately 30 percent of HHs in the $75,000-$99,999 category will be 
      apportioned above this value (Q3) and 70 percent below it (Q2). The table below compares 2000$ and 2017$.

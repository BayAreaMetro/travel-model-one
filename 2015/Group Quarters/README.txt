The gq_add_00051015.csv comes from Mike Reilly:

"I have attached the csv that I created. Note that it is just gq by type added to the 2010 data in 3 time periods. 
Also it is by old MAZ. Also, there are fewer than I remembered so you may want to just manually change the few nonzero 
records into TAZ2."

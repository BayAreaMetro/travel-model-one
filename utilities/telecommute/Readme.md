Davis, 2021. "Why working from home will stick," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 28731. All sheets include this suggested citation information. <br/> From the workbook's README: "Time series of the amount of working from home (percent of full paid days) for: the top 10 largest cities; cities 11 to 50; other small cities and towns; and select top cities. All are 6 month centered moving averages subject to data availability. Because the underlying survey question changed in November 2020, we do a 3-month average for August to October 2020 (plotted as the October data point) and separately compute the 6-month centered moving average for November 2020 and later data. We do not have reliable data on geography prior to August 2020. We define cities using Combined Statistical Areas and obtain the list of major cities by population from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_statistical_area (accessed in July 2022)." | June 2023 |

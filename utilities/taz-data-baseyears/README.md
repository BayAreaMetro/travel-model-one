# Travel Model Land Use Model Input Files

Historically all of the information that travelled form UrbanSim to Travel Model 1 moved through a single summary table at the old 1454 TAZ level. This will likely be true for Travel Model 2 as well except that the table will be built at the MAZ level. The meta table for MAZs here has been set up from the last round, please note changes in the notes.

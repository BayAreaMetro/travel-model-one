# Travel Model One Python Codebase Refactoring

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring work done to improve code reuse in the Travel Model One Python implementation. The main goal was to extract common functions from the main script (`create_tazdata_2020_and_after.py`) and place them in a shared utility file (`common.py`).

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced `common.py`**:
   - Added Census API utility functions
   - Added data processing utilities (rounding, scaling)
   - Added geographic constants and mappings
   - Added detailed documentation and usage examples

2. **Updated `create_tazdata_2020_and_after.py`**:
   - Removed functions that were moved to common.py
   - Updated imports to use functions from common.py
   - Maintained the same functionality with improved code organization

3. **Updated Unit Tests**:
   - Modified test cases to use functions from common.py
   - Ensured all tests still pass with the new code structure

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added more detailed explanations in common.py
   - Updated README_python.md with information about the code organization
   - Added this refactoring summary

## Functions Moved to common.py

The following functions were extracted from the main script and placed in common.py:

1. `retrieve_census_variables` - Retrieves data from the Census API
2. `census_to_df` - Converts Census API responses to pandas DataFrames
3. `download_acs_blocks` - Downloads block data from ACS
4. `fix_rounding_artifacts` - Fixes rounding issues in data
5. `scale_data_to_targets` - Scales data to match target values
6. `update_disaggregate_data_to_aggregate_targets` - Updates disaggregate data to match aggregate targets
7. `map_acs5year_household_income_to_tm1_categories` - Maps ACS income ranges to TM1 quartiles

## Constants Moved to common.py

Several constants were also moved to common.py:

1. `BAY_AREA_COUNTIES` - List of Bay Area county names
2. `BAYCOUNTIES` - Bay Area county FIPS codes
3. `STATE_CODE` - California state code
4. `BA_COUNTY_FIPS_CODES` - Mapping of county FIPS codes to state codes

## Benefits

This refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Code Reuse**: Common functions can now be used across multiple scripts
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to common functions only need to be made in one place
3. **Simplified Main Script**: The main script is now more focused on the workflow rather than implementation details
4. **Easier Testing**: Utility functions can be tested independently
5. **Better Documentation**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand

## Next Steps

For future work, consider:

1. Moving more domain-specific utilities to common.py as needed
2. Creating additional specialized modules for specific concerns (e.g., Census API, data processing)
3. Adding more comprehensive documentation for all functions
4. Implementing more detailed unit tests for edge cases

# Scripts and data used to create 2023 travel model land use inputs

##  [`..\create_tazdata_2020_and_after.R`](..\create_tazdata_2020_and_after.R)

This script brings in all inputs and creates 2023 input for [PopulationSim](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/PopulationSim) and [tazdata](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/modeling-website/wiki/TazData) input for [Travel Model 1.6](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one).  It also utilizes functions in [`..\common.R`](..\common.R).

See the detailed note regarding methodology at the top of [`..\create_tazdata_2020_and_after.R`](..\create_tazdata_2020_and_after.R).

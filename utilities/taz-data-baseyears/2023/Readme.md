# Scripts and data used to create 2023 travel model land use inputs

This directory relies on a [dataset created for 2020](../2020/) which is then inflated for 2023. As new data become available for ACS in September and December, 2023, these scripts will be updated.

##  [`create_2023_tazdata_from_2020_vintage.R`](create_2023_tazdata_from_2020_vintage.R)

This script brings in all inputs and creates 2023 input for [PopulationSim](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/PopulationSim) and [tazdata](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/modeling-website/wiki/TazData) input for [Travel Model 1.6](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one).

### Inputs

* **Household- and population-based variables**: Because no good data sources exist for all of the 2023 data, population and
  household data were inflated from [2020 values](../2020/) to 2023 values using a ratio of county-level 2023/2020
  [population forecasts](https://dof.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/352/Forecasting/Demographics/Documents/P2A_County_Total.xlsx)
  from the [California Department of Finance projections](https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/projections/).
* **Employment variables** are based on the [2022 LEHD WAC data](./lodes_wac_employment_2022.csv), which is created by
  [`lodes_wac_to_TAZ.py`](../lodes_wac_to_TAZ.py). This script reduces the LEHD WAC esimates based on LEHD LODES data to county totals
  that include only workers who *live* in the Bay Area. An estimate of USPS workers is also added by that script. Finally, 
  [estimated self-employed workers](taz_self_employed_workers_2023.csv) are added by 
  [`create_2023_tazdata_from_2020_vintage.R`](create_2023_tazdata_from_2020_vintage.R)
* **Employed residents** (with their occupations): Employed residents are from the 2020 esimates, but scaled to match 
  ACS 2023 Table B23025: Employment Status for the population 16 years and over by county.

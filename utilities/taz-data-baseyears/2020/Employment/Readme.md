Individuals who hold more than one job (i.e. multiple job holders) may be counted more than once. The employment figure is an estimate of the number of jobs in the area (regardless of the place of residence of the workers) rather than a count of jobs held by the residents of the area." | Free; Jan 1990 through May 2023 but 2022 & 2023 are missing 6 out of 9 Bay Area counties | `M:\Data\ CurrentEmploymentData` |

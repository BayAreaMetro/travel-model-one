Prepares a bespoke summary of travel model output. Specifically, calculates the average trip length by travel mode, tour purpose, origin superdistrict, and destination superdistrict.

In Plan Bay Area 2050 and Plan Bay Area 2050+ Draft Blueprint, the output was used as an input of the off-model calculator. See the [off-model documentation of the TM1.6.1 release version](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one/tree/TM1.6.1/utilities/RTP/Emissions/Off%20Model%20Calculators) for details.
In Plan Bay Area 2050+ Final Blueprint, the automated off-model calculation process integrated this step into [offmodel_prep.py](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one/blob/v1.6.1_develop/utilities/RTP/Emissions/Off%20Model%20Calculators/offmodel_prep.py).

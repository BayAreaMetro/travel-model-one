| Employment Development Department (EDD) - [Current Employment Statistics (CES)](https://data.edd.ca.gov/Industry-Information-/Current-Employment-Statistics-CES-/r4zm-kdcg) | county | monthly | "Current Employment by Industry (CES) data reflect jobs by "place of work." It does not include the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household employees. Jobs located in the county or the metropolitan area that pay wages and salaries are counted although workers may live outside the area. Jobs are counted regardless of the number of hours worked. Individuals who hold more than one job (i.e. multiple job holders) may be counted more than once. The employment figure is an estimate of the number of jobs in the area (regardless of the place of residence of the workers) rather than a count of jobs held by the residents of the area." | Free; Jan 1990 through May 2023 | `M:\Data\ CurrentEmploymentData` |

The state data, covering employers in the private sector and state and local government, account for approximately 95 percent of wage and salary jobs. Examples of job types beyond the scope of LEHD earnings records are: the military and other security-related federal agencies, postal workers, some employees at nonprofits and religious institutions, informal workers, and the self-employed.| `M:\Data\ Census\LEHD\ Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC)` |
| Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) [Quartery Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)](https://www.bls.gov/cew/) | county | quarterly | "QCEW produces a comprehensive tabulation of data on the number of establishments, monthly employment and quarterly wages for workers covered by State unemployment insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. These data are aggregated to many different levels, starting at the 6-digit NAICS industry level, to higher industry levels (NAICS industry groups, sectors, and supersectors), and to higher geographic levels (MSA, State, and national). At the national level, the QCEW program publishes establishment, employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the State, county and MSA level, the QCEW program publishes establishment, employment, and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. Establishment counts and wage data are available quarterly and annually. Employment data are available monthly and annually. In addition to richly detailed employment and wage data, the QCEW program produces data on establishments, employment, and wages stratified by size of establishment for the first quarter of each year." | Free; through 2022 | `M:\Data\QCEW`|

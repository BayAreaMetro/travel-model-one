1. ACS data here is downloaded for the 2017-2021 5-year dataset. The end year can be updated 
   by changing the *ACS_year* variable. 

2. ACS block group variables used in all instances where not suppressed. If suppressed at the block group 
   level, tract-level data used instead. Suppressed variables may change if ACS_year is changed. This 
   should be checked, as this change could cause the script not to work.

3. Different than the effort for 2015, many small area variables (such as age, total population, etc.) are
   available from Census 2020 data. 

4. TAZs are scaled up to match Census 2020 totals

    * Because the 2021$ equivalent of $100,000 in 2000$ ($171,876) doesn't closely align with 2021 ACS income 
      categories, households within the $150,000-$199,999 category will be apportioned above and below $171,876. 
      Using the ACS 2017-2021 PUMS data, the share of households above $171,876 within the $150,000-$199,999 
      category is 0.5035511.That is, approximately 50 percent of HHs in the $150,000-$199,999 category will be 
      apportioned above this value (Q3) and approximately 50 percent below it (Q2). The table below compares 2000$ and 2021$.

# An adjustment to the modal constant, expressed in terms of “in-vehicle travel time equivalent”

# E.g. A factor of -2 means 2 minutes of in-vehicle travel time is deducted from the utility, making the modes more attractive (increased sharing)

#   AV.Share: Specifies the share of vehicles assumed to be AVs in the vehicle fleet
#             Auto ownership ASCs will be calibrated for different levels of AV penetration
#   AV.ProbabilityBoost: The increased probability (multiplicative) for using AVs for tours, based on autos to drivers. The highest
#             this should go is 1.2
#   AV.IVTFactor: The auto in-vehicle time factor to apply to AVs
#   AV.ParkingCostFactor: The auto parking cost factor to apply to AVs, assuming some AVs are sent to remote locations or home
#   AV.CostPerMileFactor: The auto cost per mile factor to apply to AVs, assuming AVs are more efficient in terms of fuel consumption than human-driven vehicles
#   AV.TerminalTimeFactor: The factor to apply to terminal time for AVs, assuming AVs offer curbside passenger pickup/dropoff

# AV impacts on road capacity - represented by adjusting passenger car equivalents (PCEs) by facility type
# AV_PCE_FAC is a factor between 0 and 1

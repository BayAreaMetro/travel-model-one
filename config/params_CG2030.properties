#   AV.Share: Specifies the share of vehicles assumed to be AVs in the vehicle fleet

#   AV.IVTFactor: The auto in-vehicle time factor to apply to AVs
#   AV.ParkingCostFactor: The auto parking cost factor to apply to AVs, assuming some AVs are sent to remote locations or home
#   AV.CostPerMileFactor: The auto cost per mile factor to apply to AVs, assuming AVs are more efficient in terms of fuel consumption than human-driven vehicles

	Support for tasks to access and sharing data.
	The data can be specified either as in-memory or accessed through a URL.
	<p>In-memory data is transported to the nodes along with he tasks, so it is immediately accessible without
	need for reading it from or writing it to a specified source.
	<p>URL-based data is accessed through a URL, where the URL specifies the location of the data, and the
	actual data is provided as an input stream. This method takes advantage of the JDK's built-in support
	for multiple protocols, including HTTP, FTP, Jar, File and Gopher.

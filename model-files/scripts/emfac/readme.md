[RunPrepareEmfac.bat](../../RunPrepareEmfac.bat)

This batch job processes three types of activity data (by county) for input into EMFAC to run in Burden mode 
and calculating regional on-road emission inventories.  The three types of activity data (all by county) that will 
be inputted are: (1) vehicle speed distribution files (for passenger vehicle types only); (2) vmt files by time of 
day and fuel type; (3) vehicle population files by vehicle type and fuel type.

There are five scripts/steps that produce the activity data input into EMFAC. 

Step (1) [BetweenZonesVMT.py](BetweenZonesVMT.py)

This script extracts link level VMT and speeds for the 13 ARB speed cohorts.
This generic script forecast year run applies for all 5 timeperiods.      

Step (2) [CreateSpeedBinsWithinZones.job](CreateSpeedBinsWithinZones.job)

This script - a) extracts intrazonal level VMT and speeds; and b) extracts total daily trips for the 13 ARB speed cohorts. This generic script forecast year run also applies for all 5 timeperiods.      

Step (3) [create_EMFAC_custom_activity_file.py](create_EMFAC_custom_activity_file.py)

This script reads the files generated by the previous two scripts, and 
fills in an EMFAC Custom Activity Template with the modeled data to create
the custom activity file input to EMFAC.

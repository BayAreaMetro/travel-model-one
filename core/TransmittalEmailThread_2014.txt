Subject:	RE: Syntax for using properties tokens in UECs?

The latest change (between 12/8/2014 and 12/10/2014) does not affect model results.  In the event if 
the inappropriate hashmap lookup did occur, the model run would have crashed (it would not be able to 
retrieve the size term needed for the SOA model for certain activity segments).  This error case was 
encountered, and subsequently addressed, only very recently when the run on a new setup for the ARC 
model crashed.  The fact that such runtime exception was never encountered during past runs of the 
MTC model suggests that the error did not take place.  And since the fix is targeted at only handling the 
error case, other paths through the code would not be affected.  

The enhancements made to the SOA model to improve computational efficiency could presumably 
change the model results if the feature is turned on (so that the ‘Generic’ utility function is applied 
instead of the purpose-specific utility function).  But when the feature is turned off (by setting the 
property StopLocationSoa.useGenericSOAModel to “0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0”), the original purpose-
specific utility functions will be applied and the results will therefore be identical to what’s produced by 
the JAR prior to the SOA enhancement.  Even with the feature turned on, our evaluation for the ARC 
implementation indicated minimal changes in the overall trip distance distributions while the 
computational performance gain was significant.

Thank you.  Is there a changelog of what’s in this version compared to what we had before?
Are these changes expected to have no effect on model results?

Hi Lisa,

It seems that the MTC model setup on github is missing the pieces needed to work with the enhanced 
SOA model.

Via this link please download the 5 files that will need to be updated: 
https://ftp.pbworld.com/GetFile.aspx?fn=2004691754.zip

Properties File
The following was added to the “mtcTourBased-master.properties” file (line 142):
StopLocationSoa.useGenericSOAModel=1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

UEC
A new sheet labeled as “Generic” was added to “StopDestinationChoiceAlternativeSample.xls”

Source Code
“StopDestinationSampleOfAlternativesModel.java” and 
“StopDestinationSampleOfAlternativesModelGeneric.java” to go into 
\models\ctramp\src\java\com\pb\models\ctramp\jppf\
I took the opportunity to update these classes again (from the version sent on Monday) to incorporate 
the bug fix that was recently implemented in the ctramp code branch for the ARC implementation.  This 
fix is more of a preventive measure to better handle potentially inappropriate hashmap lookups.  

New JAR
The JAR file has been rebuilt with the two updated java files. 

Hopefully these updates will get the model going on your end.  

Thanks,

Jessica

Yes, " StopLocationSoa.useGenericSOAModel" is a newer feature.  Can you please send me the property 
file that you use?  I'll check what else might need to be included.

It got further this time, yay!  It looks like it's looking for the StopLocationSoa.useGenericSOAModel 
property.
Is that new?  What should it be to return the same results?  Are there lots of diffs in this jar?

My re-build is under projects/mtc/release/mtc.jar - please give it a try.  We will also test the JAR on our 
end.

I updated our java version (to 1.7.0_71, which is the oldest one for which I could find a jdk installer) and

Could I get a copy of the source code that was compiled into this mtc.jar?

Hi Lisa, I compiled the jar using java 1.7.0_65. That might be the cause of the error, I am not sure. To be

to this version, and re-launch all processes. Let me know if you get the same error.

Hi Lisa,

You've set everything up correctly, so I think you maybe aren't using the latest version of the code. I 
have compiled the latest code that's been checked into subversion and created a jar file which you can 
download here<https://ftp.pbworld.com/GetFile.aspx?fn=1959534045.zip>.



Please let me know if this works or not.

Hi Joel --

Hmm, my test is failing with a parse error, pasted below at the bottom of this email.



I've attached an image of the UEC and the properties file as well.



Is it possible that we're not using a recent enough version of the code?  It does print this at the 
beginning:

21-Nov-2014 14:51:22, INFO, MTC Tour Based Model using CT-RAMP version 1.0.8.81, 22feb2011 build 2



The source code I see laying about is dated 7/25/2013 (for the Expression.java file and the 
UtilityExpressionCalculator.java file), but Dave notes that he doesn't compile it anyhow so it's not clear 
that the binaries we have match the source.  I glanced at the Expression.java and nothing jumped out at 
me for handling the %propvar% expression, but I didn't scrutinize very closely.  Do you know when these 
changes went in?  Could we get a recent binary?



Thank you!

-Lisa

Subject: RE: Syntax for using properties tokens in UECs?



Hi Lisa, it is simple. Just set the token on the property file, for example:

auto.operating.cost=19.5



Then in the uec set a user-defined token  such as aoc by referncing the value in the property file in the 
variable field:



%auto.operating.cost%



Note that the property file tokens can only be referred to in the variable field. Otherwise it works the 
same way as the tokens on the data page.



Let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject: Syntax for using properties tokens in UECs?



Hi Joel & Jim -



Dave said that recent updates to CTRAMP have made it so that UECs can just references tokens from 
.properties files. (We'd like to move things like auto operating costs out of the UECs so they can be in 
one spot for a run.) What's the syntax for referencing the properties in the UECs?



Thanks!

-Lisa

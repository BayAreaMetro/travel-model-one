/**
 * This bundler implementation computes bundle sizes propertional to the mean execution
 * time for each node to the power of n, where n is an integer value specified in the configuration file as "proportionality factor".<br>
 * The scope of this bundler is all nodes, which means that it computes the size for all nodes,
 * unless an override is specified by the nodes.<br>
 * The mean execution time is computed as a moving average over a number of tasks, specified in the bundling
 * algorithm profile configuration as &quot;minSamplesToAnalyse&quot;<br>
 * This algorithm is well suited for relatively small networks (a few dozen nodes at most). It generates an overhead
 * everytime the performance data for a node is updated. In the case of a small network, this overhead is not
 * large enough to impact the overall performance significantly.

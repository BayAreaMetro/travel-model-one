/**
 * This class is a template for a standard JPPF task.
 * There are 3 parts to a task that is to be executed on a JPPF grid:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the task initialization: this is done on the client side, generally from the task constructor,
 * or via explicit method calls on the task from the application runner.</li>
 * <li>the task execution: this part is performed by the node. It consists in invoking the {@link #run() run()} method,
 * and handling an eventual uncaught {@link java.lang.Throwable Throwable} that would result from this invocation.</li>
 * <li>getting the execution results: the task itself, after its execution, is considered as the result.
 * JPPF provides the convenience methods {@link org.jppf.server.protocol.JPPFTask#setResult(java.lang.Object) setResult(Object)} and
 * {@link org.jppf.server.protocol.JPPFTask#getResult() getResult()}
 * to this effect, however any accessible attribute of the task will be available when the task is returned to the client.</li>
 * </ol>

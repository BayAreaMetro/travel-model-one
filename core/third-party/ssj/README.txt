SSJ, Stochastic Simulation in Java
==========================

SSJ is a Java library for stochastic simulation, developed in the 
Département d'Informatique et de Recherche
Opérationnelle (DIRO), at the Université de Montréal.
It provides facilities for generating uniform and nonuniform random 
variates, computing different measures related to probability 
distributions, performing goodness-of-fit tests, applying 
quasi-Monte Carlo methods, collecting statistics (elementary),
and programming discrete-event simulations with both events and processes.
Additional Java packages are also developed on top of SSJ for simulation
applications in finance, call centers management, communication networks, etc

See the file INSTALL.txt for more details.

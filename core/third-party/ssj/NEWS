   * Removed the two-dimensionnal distributions BiNormalDist, BiNormalGenzDist,
     ContinuousDistribution2Dim, BiNormalDonnellyDist, BivariateTDist and
     moved them to package probdistmulti. The BivariateTDist distribution has
     been renamed BiStudentDist.

   * New methods getMean, getVariance and getStandardDeviation to get the mean,
     the variance and the standard deviation for probability distributions.

   * New methods getMaximumLikelihoodEstimate and getInstanceFromMLE that imple-
     ment the maximum likelihood estimator for most probability distributions.

   * New probability distributions: UniformIntDist, FatigueLifeDist, PascalDist,
     FisherFDist, HyperbolicSecantDist, InverseGaussianDist, LoglogisticDist,
     Pearson5Dist, Pearson6Dist.

   * The distribution NegativeBinomialDist now takes a double instead of an int
     as its first parameter; the distribution with an integer as first
     parameter is now called PascalDist (it is the former NegativeBinomialDist).

   * New methods in DistributionFactory.

- package randvar
   * New non-uniform random number generators: UniformIntGen, FatigueLifeGen,
     FisherFGen, HyperbolicSecantGen, InverseGaussianGen, LoglogisticGen,
     Pearson5Gen, Pearson6Gen.

   * New class RandomVariateGenWithCache: caches random values for more
     efficiency when using common random numbers.

   * The generator NegativeBinomialConvolutionGen has been renamed
     PascalConvolutionGen.

     efficiency, and TruncatedRandomStream, which generates uniform random
     numbers in a subinterval of [0, 1].

     interface for accessing a database), MathFunction (to pass an arbitrary
     function as argument to another) and Misc (miscellaneous functions).

==========================================================================
What is new in version SSJ-1.1.9

- package randvar
  Added the classes BetaSymmetricalPolarGen and BetaSymmetricalBestGen
    that generate symmetrical Beta variates.

- package rng
  Provided a faster method to jump the the next substreams in all the WELL*
  generators and in the F2NL607 generator.

- package probdist
  * Replaced all functions Math.log(1+x) by Num.log1p(x) for better accuracy.

  * Corrected LogarithmicDist:
       the probabilities were not always computed correctly.

  * Corrected a bug in BinomialDist:
       the method inverseF(u) had a bug for n = 1.

       classes BiNormalDist, BiNormalDonnellyDist and BiNormalGenzDist

    arguments constructor has been eliminated and the 4 arguments constructor
    of the previous version has become the 3 arguments constructor
    of the new version. This gives the correct generating matrices for the
    Niederreiter-Xing sequence; the old 3 arguments constructor used
    the transposed generating matrices.

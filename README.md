# travel-model-one
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) maintains a simulation model of typical weekday travel to assist in regional planning activities.  MTC makes the software and scripts necessary to implement the model as well as detailed model results available to the public.  Users of the model and/or the model's results are entirely responsible for the outcomes, interpretations, and conclusions they reach from the information.  Users of the MTC model or model results shall in no way imply MTC's support or review of their findings or analyses.
